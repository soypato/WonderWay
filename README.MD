## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get WonderWay up and running:

1. **Add the Tripadvisor API Key file**:  
   Create a file named `tripKey.ts` **in the parent folder** of the main project directory.  
   This acts like a `.env` file to store your access token securely.

   Example content:

   ```ts
   export const tripkey = {
     production: true,
     token: 'your_tripadvisor_token_here'
   };
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Angular project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd code
   ```

4. **Start the Angular development server**:

   ```bash
   ng serve -o
   ```

5. **Start the JSON backend server**:  
   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `code` folder again:

   ```bash
   cd code
   json-server db/db.json
   ```

6. üéâ That‚Äôs it! Open your browser and start exploring **WonderWay**.
